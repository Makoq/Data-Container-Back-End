You also have to select which field you want to have in \nthe resulting table [Transect_Result]. This can be an ID of the polygon theme if you \nwant to link the tables later on, or any other field [Theme_Field].\n","tool_id":"0","tool_name":"Transect through polygon shapefile","tool_path":"http://geomodeling.njnu.edu.cn/OpenGMS/page/model-item-info/model-item-info.html?NDYyMDU3OGMtNzNiOS00NWJmLTg3MjYtNzg3ODkyYzMwYTZhZjU=","oid":"5b90e7bbd15d75093cb58842","stateId":"6C0B04EF-75A8-402f-814E-8B5DEAC2E616","mdlId":"B97B54E0-EC0D-4d2c-A677-C4139E53ACE2"}]}
