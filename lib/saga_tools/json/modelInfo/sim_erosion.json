(Morgan & Duzant 2008).<br/>This tool is called MMF-SAGA because some things have been implemented differently compared to the original publication. The most important are:<br/><br/><ul><li>the extension of the model to support spatially distributed modelling</li><li>the introduction of a \"Channel Network\" layer</li><li>the introduction of a \"rainfall duration\" (time span) parameter</li><li>the exposure of the flow depth parameter</li></ul><br/><br/>A more detailed description of the model, its modifications, and model application is provided by Setiawan (2012), chapter 6.<br/>Currently, a number of additional grid datasets are outputted to facilitate model evaluation.
