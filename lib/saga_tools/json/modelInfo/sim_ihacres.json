{"Version":"1.0","author":"Stefan Liersch (c) 2008","library_description":"The metric conceptual rainfall-runoff model <b>IHACRES</b> (Identification of unit Hydrographs and Component flows from Rainfall, Evaporation and Streamflow data) has been implemented as a module library. The IHACRES model was developed by: Jakeman, A.J. and G.M. Hornberger (1993); Jakeman et al. (1990).\n\n<b>Purpose</b>\nThe tool can be used to simulate streamflow (catchment runoff) on the basis of daily rainfall and temperature data. No spatial data, such as elevation models, soil or land use maps are required.\n\nIHACRES has been applied to catchments with a wide range of climatologies and sizes (Croke et al., 2004). It has been used to predict streamflow in ungauged catchments (Kokkonen et al., 2003; Post and Jakeman, 1999; Post et al., 1998), to study land cover effects on hydrologic processes (Croke et al., 2004; Kokkonen and Jakeman, 2002), and to investigate dynamic response characteristics and physical catchment descriptors (Kokkonen et al., 2003; Sefton and Howarth, 1998).\n\nMore recently, the model has been used to develop a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ufz.de/index.php?en=17175\">rainfall-runoff database</a> for flood risk assessment and forecasting by Liersch, S. and M. Volk (2008) (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.iemss.org/iemss2008/uploads/Main/S05-12_Liersch_et_al-IEMSS2008.pdf\">pdf</a>).\n\n<b>References</b>\n<ul><li>Croke, B.F.W., Merritt, W.S., Jakeman, A.J., 2004.
