In contrast to the common TOPMODEL (Beven & Kirkby, 1979) - based TWI, this index differs in such that it considers hydraulic conductivity to be constant in a soil mantle overlying relatively impermeable bedrock. Also, it uses the sine of the slope rather than its tangens, which is more correct and significantly matters for steeper slopes that give raise to landslides. For computation, a slope (in radians) and a catchment area (in m2) grid are required. Additionally, information on groundwater recharge (m/hr), material hydraulic conductivity (m/hr), and depth to potential shear plane (m) are required that can be specified either globally or through grids.
